# DeepDetect: Learning All-in-One Dense Keypoints

This repository contains the code used in the paper **DeepDetect: Learning All-in-One Dense Keypoints** â€” DeepDetect is an intelligent, adaptable, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that uses deep learning
to learn the strengths of 7 strong keypoint detectors (SIFT, ORB, BRISK, FAST, AGAST, Harris Corner Detector, and Shi-Tomasi Corners) and 2 well-known edge detectors (Canny and Sobel). It provides highly dense and semantically meaningful keypoints, demonstrating robustness to poor visibility and brightness, low contrast, and complex scenes, without requiring manual tuning.

## Note:
We provide only a few images from the Training and Validation sets used in our work due to storage limitations. However, the provided samples are sufficient to give users a clear understanding of the dataset.
