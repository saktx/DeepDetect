# DeepDetect: Learning All-in-One Dense Keypoints

This repository contains the code used in the paper **DeepDetect: Learning All-in-One Dense Keypoints** â€” DeepDetect is an intelligent, adaptable, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that uses deep learning
to learn the strengths of 7 strong keypoint detectors (SIFT, ORB, BRISK, FAST, AGAST, Harris Corner Detector, and Shi-Tomasi Corners) and 2 well-known edge detectors (Canny and Sobel). It provides highly dense and semantically meaningful keypoints, demonstrating robustness to poor visibility and brightness, low contrast, and complex scenes, without requiring manual tuning.

Following Jupyter notebooks are provided publicly:

## Note:
We provide only a few images from the Training and Validation sets used in our work due to storage limitations. However, the provided samples are sufficient to give users a clear understanding of the dataset.
